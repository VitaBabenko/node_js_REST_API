The Backend Node.js Application is a server-side application that provides the functionality and logic for a web-based system. It handles the business logic, data processing, and communication with the database or other external services.

The Backend Node.js Application is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

1. Node.js
2. Express.js
3. MongoDB

Usage:
Once the Backend Node.js Application is up and running, you can interact with it using API clients (web browsers, command-line tools like URL, or API testing tools like Postman).

To use this application, follow these steps:

1. Send requests to the appropriate API endpoints, including the necessary parameters and request bodies.
2. Receive responses from the server, which will contain the requested data or appropriate status/error codes.
